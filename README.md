## [ebusd](https://github.com/LukasGrebe/ha-addons/tree/main/ebusd) 

This Add-on runs [ebusd](http://ebusd.eu), a daemon for handling communication with eBUS devices connected to a 2-wire bus system (“energy bus” used by numerous heating systems), in [Home Assistant OS](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi). You can simply plugin a ebus hardware interface into your RaspberryPi, and install the addon to run ebusd.
